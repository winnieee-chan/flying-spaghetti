// src/services/candidateService.ts
// This service would contain the logic for:
// 1. Scoring (applying the scoring formula from scorer.js)
// 2. Filtering (complex filtering beyond simple db retrieval)
// 3. Outreach generation (calling an LLM to generate personalized messages)

// For now, it will remain empty, as most logic is in routes or db.ts.
